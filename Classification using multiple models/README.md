# Data description

•	The data set contains 8 predictor variables and a target variable
•	The target variable has three categories of employees (who use cars to commute to workplace, who use public transport, who use two wheelers)
•	Altogether, there are 444 observations (rows)
•	Predictor variables include attributes - salary, work experience, distance of workplace from home, age, whether the employee has a driving license, gender and qualification


# Objective of analysis.
*To build multiple classification models to predict whether or not an employee will use car as a mode of transport
Models to be compared are - Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Bagging and Boosting

# Steps involved
Exploratory analysis of the dataset - missing value treatment, correlation check and heatmap generation, bivariate analysis through charts and plots
Data preparation - balancing the target variable in-case required, splitting the data into train and test
Model building and result comparison through confusion matrix
